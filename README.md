## 🎯 Problem Statement

Tourism is one of the largest industries in India, yet many people find traveling uninteresting or lack motivation to explore cultural heritage, traditions, and local products. Existing tourism apps often focus only on navigation, bookings, and itineraries, but fail to provide an immersive and engaging experience.

There is a need for an innovative solution that:
- **Promotes Indian culture and traditions globally** 🌍
- **Motivates even non-travel enthusiasts** through gamification 🎮
- **Supports local businesses and products** by integrating rewards 🛍️
- **Encourages sustainable and participatory tourism** 🌱

## 🏆 Objective

XP Lore aims to:

1. **Gamify Tourism** – Introduce XP, HP, stamina, badges, and levels to make traveling feel like a game.
2. **AI-Powered Trip Planning** – Provide personalized trip plans (pre-release using Gemini, later with a custom AI model).
3. **Reward Engagement** – Offer crypto tokens redeemable at hotels, restaurants, and local stores.
4. **Cultural Promotion** – Highlight Indian traditions, festivals, and locally made products.
5. **Event-Based Tourism** – Encourage visits during cultural festivals (e.g., Onam in Kerala).
6. **Support Local Ecosystem** – Boost local tourism, food, crafts, and hospitality businesses.
7. **Sustainable Exploration** – Promote responsible tourism practices while making exploration fun and participatory.
